# Hi, I'm Jhanvi 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer with a focus on **TypeScript, React, Node.js, and GenAI workflows**.  
I like taking ideas from “rough sketch” to **deployed product** – APIs, frontend, cloud, and everything in between.

- 🎓 M.S. Informatics, Northeastern University (Boston)
- 🏗️ Recent builds: full-stack **AMRAP Gym System**, **GenAI procurement chatbot**, and **Brewbook city guide**
- 🌱 Currently deepening: clean architecture, TypeScript, and LLM-powered apps

---

## 💼 Experience

I’ve worked as a software engineer in **Startup Environments**, as well as on academic and project-based teams, building full-stack and GenAI-powered products.

My work includes taking ideas from early concepts to deployed systems, working across frontend, backend, and cloud, and shipping features used by real users.

## 📌 What I like building

- Full-stack apps with **React + TypeScript + Node.js**
- Backends with **clean architecture**, DI, and **Prisma + SQL**
- **GenAI tools** using OpenAI, LangChain, Pinecone
- Dashboards and internal tools that actually get used 🙂
